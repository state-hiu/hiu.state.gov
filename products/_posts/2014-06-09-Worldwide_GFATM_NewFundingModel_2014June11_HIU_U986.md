The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is a critical multilateral vehicle for donors to contribute to the shared global responsibility and support country leadership on the three diseases. The United States is working with partner countries to ensure that each dollar invested achieves the greatest possible health impact. With U.S. support, the Fund is now reforming its work to increase the impact of its investments. In addition, the United States and the Global Fund are strengthening their collaboration under the leadership of partner countries.
