Increases in air temperatures over the past three decades have resulted in greater evaporative water loss from lakes and reservoirs across Africa, potentially contributing to long-term water insecurity. Mitigation strategies that reduce water loss can minimize the impacts of further air temperature increases. Floating solar panels can reduce water loss by up to 90% over covered areas and also produce 6% more energy than land-based units. Additional mitigation strategies include designing deep reservoirs with minimal surface areas, installing partial coverings on lakes and reservoirs, and developing underground storage systems.
