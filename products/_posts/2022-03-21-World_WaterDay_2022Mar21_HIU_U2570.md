World Water Day in 2022 highlights the importance and challenges of managing groundwater in a changing climate, while also recognizing 25% of the global population lacks access to safe water.  Groundwater reserves represent the largest portion of freshwater on the planet, yet increasing human population sizes, changes in climate, and the transboundary nature of many aquifers are presenting challenges to managing and sharing these resources.
