Over 1.6 million people are internally displaced (74% of the population), according to OCHA. Since November 5, approximately 200,000 internally displaced people within the evacuation area complied with Israeli orders to move southwards along the Salah ad Din corridor during announced evacuation windows. Hundreds of thousands of people unwilling or unable to leave the north are increasingly vulnerable. Humanitarian actors are calling for unhindered, safe, and secure access for some 500 trucks a day, in line with the Gaza Stripâ€™s daily imports prior to October 7. Without fuel shipments, by November 14 UNRWA trucks will be unable to take delivery and distribute aid within the Gaza Strip, according to OCHA reporting.
