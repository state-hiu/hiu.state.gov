According to UNHCR, over 5.9 million refugees fled Ukraine to neighboring countries since February 24th, including 3.2 million to Poland. An estimated 1.5 million Ukrainians returned since February 28th, but the situation remains volatile and returns may not be permanent. The latest IOM survey estimates the country is coping with 8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) as of May 3rd, a 4% increase since the April 17th IOM survey. Around 49% of the current IDPs are from the eastern oblasts. As of May 8th, OHCHR reported 7,061 civilian casualties (3,381 killed and 3,680 injured).
