 In the fiscal year 2012, the American people, through the U.S. Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), supported the fight against global AIDS through bilateral and regional programs in over 70 countries. As a result of this commitment, the U.S. directly supported life-saving treatment for 5.1 million men, women and children worldwide. In addition, in 2012, the U.S. was the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Country Operational Plans (COPs) document annual investments and anticipated results in HIV/AIDS and are the basis for approval of the majority of annual bilateral HIV/AIDS funding. Several multi-country platforms develop Regional Operational Plans. Countries with smaller HIV/AIDS portfolios are funded through foreign assistance operational plans and do not develop COPs.
