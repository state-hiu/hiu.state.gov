An unprecedented 36.7 million people were displaced across Africa as of December 31, 2021 due to disaster, conflict, violence, or persecution, up from 30.1 million two years earlier. Conflicts in multiple countries across the continent drove the increase, with the rate of internal displacement increasing twice as fast as refugee movements in 2021. Humanitarian needs have continued in 2022, with UN funding appeals for Africa up 14% compared to 2021. Of the $18 billion in 2022 appeals, approximately 50% remain unfunded as of November 2022.
