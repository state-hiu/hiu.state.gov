Over 382,000 Sudanese refugees and asylum seekers and nearly 50,000 returning Chadian citizens have crossed the border from Sudan into Chad since April. The new arrivals join nearly 1 million forcibly displaced people already hosted by Chad, including hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees still in Chad from the genocide in Darfur twenty years ago. The Chadian government estimates another 200,000 people will arrive by December, further exacerbating the strain on limited shelter, food, water, hygiene, and sanitation resources. The rainy season, which runs from May to September in this region, compounds logistical challenges as the movement of people and humanitarian supplies are hindered or completely halted when roads become flooded and impassable. Numerous reports from multiple organizations indicate the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias have carried out pervasive sexual violence, targeted ethnic violence, mass killings, and the burning of towns and IDP camps across the Darfur region. Continuing violence is severely limiting humanitarian access, with many aid organizations in Sudan having partially or completely suspended operations. Reduced humanitarian presence also likely disrupts access to the full scope of information on potential atrocities.
