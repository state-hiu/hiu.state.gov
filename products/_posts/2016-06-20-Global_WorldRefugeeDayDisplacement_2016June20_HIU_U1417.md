By the end of 2015, more than 65 million people were forcibly displaced due to conflict: the highest number ever reported. Conflict had internally displaced 40.8 million persons and 21.3 million refugees had fled across borders because of war and persecution. An additional 3.2 million people in industrialized countries were awaiting decisions on asylum. In recent months, violence has sparked mass displacements both across and within borders in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Burundi, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In addition, 19.2 million were internally displaced as a result of natural disasters in 2015.
