Conflict is the biggest driver of hunger, with 79% of the worldâ€™s most food insecure living in 22 countries or areas afflicted by conflict. It is a contributing factor pushing populations in Somalia, South Sudan, Mali, and Burkina Faso to the brink of starvation. Conflict is one of multiple compounding factors that account for at least 239 million people facing severe acute food insecurity in the 55 countries and areas included in this snapshot. Political instability, extreme weather events, and economic shocks such as inflation and high food prices join conflict in driving hunger to levels that pose immediate danger to lives or livelihoods of affected populations.
