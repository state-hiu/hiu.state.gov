Boko Haram-related conflict continues to restrict humanitarian access in the Lake Chad Basin region, where an estimated 10.7 million people need assistance and 2.4 million are displaced. While the overall food security situation remains grave, approximately 4.5 million people are food insecure in the Lake Chad Basin region. However, this is a decline from a height of 7 million last year.
