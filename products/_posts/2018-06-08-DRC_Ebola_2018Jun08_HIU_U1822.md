The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo–first reported on May 8th, 2018–has killed 27 people so far, but remains isolated to the three health zones: Wangata, Iboko, and Bikoro.  The location of this outbreak, which includes cases in Mbandaka, a city with a population of approximately 1.2 million that lies on the heavily traveled Congo river, has put at risk Kinshasa, Brazzaville, and the Central African Republic’s capital Bangui.
