Fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since April 15 has forced the internal displacement of 2.1 million people while over 583,000 refugees fled to neighboring countries. 24.7 million people (50 percent of Sudan’s population) need humanitarian assistance. 19.1 million people may face acute food insecurity in the next 3–6 months. 60 percent of health facilities are non-operational due to dwindling, looted, or destroyed supplies.
