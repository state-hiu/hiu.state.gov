Syrians fleeing conflict and violence and insecurity are being internally and externally displaced. This map identifies IDP sites in Syria, official refugee camp locations in Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq, as well as areas in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq  where sizable concentrations of Syrians are living in urban areas. It also shows numbers of externally displaced Syrians reported in the neighboring countries, as well as in Egypt and North Africa with charts to illustrate numbers of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries and living in camps or outside camps. The information therein was updated February 2017.
