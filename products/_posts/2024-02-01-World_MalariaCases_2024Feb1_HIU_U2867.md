The world saw an estimated 249 million malaria cases in 2022, erasing nearly a decade of progress towards the goal of eliminating malaria globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Flooding exacerbated by climate change, increasing cross-border travel and refugee movements, and a breakdown of health services in areas with active conflict contributed to the majority of the increase in malaria cases from 2021 to 2022. Nearly 90% of people in need of humanitarian assistance live in malaria-endemic countries, according to the WHO, where humanitarian emergencies disrupt treatment and prevention programs, expand mosquito breeding sites, and expose displaced, non-immune populations to the disease.
