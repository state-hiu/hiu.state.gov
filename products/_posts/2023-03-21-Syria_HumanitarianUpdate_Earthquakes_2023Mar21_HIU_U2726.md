---
The February earthquakes exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Syria by damaging healthcare facilities,
water and sanitation infrastructure, and causing additional displacement. Syria already faced a dire humanitarian crisis driven
by 12 years of conflict. Prior to the earthquakes, over 15 million people (almost 70% of the population) needed humanitarian assistance. Only 59% of hospitals and 57% of primary healthcare facilities were fully functional, and more than half of the population relied on unsafe water sources. Of Syriaâ€™s 6.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), 2.1 million live in settlements and camps, largely in northwest Syria.
