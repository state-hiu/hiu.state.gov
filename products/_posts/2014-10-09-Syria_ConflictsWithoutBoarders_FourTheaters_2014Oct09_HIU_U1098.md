Conflicts Without Borders refers to a conflict in one country that draws in other governments and non-state actors, exacerbates stresses and conflict in the neighboring countries, and generates displacement across borders. This product visualizes a regional humanitarian emergency, as well as dividing it into four distinct but overlapping theaters: Northern Syria and Turkey, Western Syria and Lebanon, Southern Syria and Jordan, and Eastern Syria and Iraq. Each regional theater highlights areas of influence of the Asad regime, ISIL, Jabhat-al-Nusra, Kurdish elements, and moderate opposition groups as well as contested areas.  Areas of influence are current for Iraq as of August 20, 2014, and current for Syria as of September 5, 2014.  The map also details key events in the conflict and provides information on displacement of affected populations both internally and into surrounding countries.
