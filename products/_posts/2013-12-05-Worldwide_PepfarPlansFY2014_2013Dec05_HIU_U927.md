The American people, through the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), supports the fight against global AIDS through bilateral and regional programs in over 65 countries. As a result of this commitment, the U.S. directly supported life-saving treatment for 6.7 million men, women and children worldwide. In addition, the U.S. is the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
