This map illustrates the severe food insecurity and displacement situation throughout the Lake Chad region due to the Boko Haram-related conflict as of mid-December 2016. Access constraints have led to an elevated risk of ongoing famine in several Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Northeast Nigeria and displacement numbers continue to increase.
