In January 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the global cholera crisis to a Grade 3 emergency, its highest level, as global cases increased by 50% over the past year. Of the 30 countries that reported outbreaks in 2022, 18 are experiencing ongoing outbreaks. Case rates in 2023 continue to trend upwards. Many affected countries reported higher case fatality rates in 2022 than in previous years. Cholera is caused by contaminated water or food and is preventable and treatable, but scarcity of clean water, lack of basic sanitation, and a global vaccine shortage continue to put vulnerable populations at risk.
