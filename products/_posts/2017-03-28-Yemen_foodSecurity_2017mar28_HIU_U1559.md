According to the Yemen IPC NTWG, an estimated 17 million Yemenis, 60% of the population, are in crisis or worse (IPC phase 3 and 4) food insecurity due to ongoing conflict, restrictions on food and fuel imports, and high food prices. Humanitarian operations are hindered by ongoing conflict and insecurity, bureaucratic impediments, damage to roads and bridges, and low levels of funding.
