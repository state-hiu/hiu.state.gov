The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has recorded at least 5 million refugees from Ukraine in the countries reflected in this snapshot since February 24, 2022 and anticipates as many as 2 million additional refugees by March 2023. At least 4.9 million refugees are registered under the EUâ€™s Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) or similar national protection schemes, representing 97% of the 5 million refugees. In October 2022, the European Council extended the TPD an additional 12 months to March 2024.
