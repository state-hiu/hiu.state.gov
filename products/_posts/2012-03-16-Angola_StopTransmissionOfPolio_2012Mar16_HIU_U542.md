Despite being eradicated in 2001, polio reestablished itself in Angola in 2005. An international effort to combat the disease has dramatically reduced infections, with no reported cases since July 2011. The joint CDC and WHO program Stop Transmission of Polio (STOP) is supporting an Angolan government-led effort to ensure that every child is vaccinated during the course of national campaigns. As Angola nears a polio-free year, the STOP team is working to prevent polio reemergence in high risk areas.
