Syrians fleeing conflict and violence are being internally and externally displaced. This map identifies official camp locations in Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq, as well as areas in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq  where sizable concentrations of Syrians are living in urban areas. It also shows numbers of externally displaced Syrians reported in the four neighboring countries, as well as in Egypt and North Africa, and the UNâ€™s estimate of how many people are displaced inside Syria. The graph charts quarterly cumulative numbers of Syrians in neighboring countries registered or awaiting registration for humanitarian assistance from December 2012 to March 2014. The pie chart illustrates the total cumulative numbers of Syrians in neighboring countries, as well as in Egypt and North Africa, registered or awaiting registration for humanitarian assistance. The situation is changing rapidly, and the data, based on estimates from U.S. Government, UN and NGO open source reports, is current as of March 12, 2014.
