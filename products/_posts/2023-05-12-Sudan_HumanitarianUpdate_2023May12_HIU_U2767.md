An estimated 736,000 people have been internally displaced since the April 15 violence began and more than 204,000 refugees and refugee returnees have fled Sudan. The new displacement comes on top of an existing displacement crisis of 3.8 million internally displaced Sudanese, 1.1 million refugees hosted in Sudan, and nearly 830,000 Sudanese refugees in neighboring countries. UNHCR is anticipating $445 million will be needed to assist arriving refugees and returnees in five neighboring countries until October. This is in addition to the existing 2023 UN humanitarian appeals, including $1.7 billion to assist 12.5 million people in Sudan.
