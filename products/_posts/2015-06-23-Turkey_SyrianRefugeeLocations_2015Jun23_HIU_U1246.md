According to UNHCR, in 2014 Syria became the worldâ€™s largest source country of refugees and Turkey became the largest host country of Syrians. The country-wide map shows the concentrations of displaced Syrians by province; the border region map shows the locations of refugee camps. An accompanying chart identifies the increase in registered Syrians in camps and urban areas.
