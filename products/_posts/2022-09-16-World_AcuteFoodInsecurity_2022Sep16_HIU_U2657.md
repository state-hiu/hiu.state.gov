Acute food insecurity continues to worsen in 2022 with at least 244 million people food insecure in the 55 countries and areas included in this snapshot. Global food insecurity will remain severe into 2023 and continue to impact livelihoods and contribute to displacement, especially impacting populations in low-to-middle income countries. Armed conflict/insecurity, climate change, extreme weather events, and economic shocks, including COVID-19 and economic mismanagement, are driving severe outcomes. The war in Ukraine has increased global food, fuel, and fertilizer prices, which might decrease crop yields in the coming years and exacerbate food insecurity. Some households in Ethiopia, Yemen, South Sudan, and Somalia will continue to face extreme food consumption gaps into 2023 (IPC Phase 5 Catastrophe). The IPC projects parts of Somalia will experience famine (IPC Phase 5 Famine) this year.
