Russian missiles, bombs, and artillery are responsible for damaging and destroying health care infrastructure across Ukraine, killing and injuring medical staff and patients. Hospitals, medical clinics, and ambulances have all come under attack as the conflict moved from Kyiv to Kharkiv, from Mariupol to Mykolaiv, and reached as far away from the front lines as Vinnytsia. International aid organizations and foreign press have documented over 200 Russian military attacks on Ukraineâ€™s medical system since February. Health care providers in conflict zones do not have adequate access to medical supplies to care for the sick or injured when, as highlighted in the siege of Mariupol, the health care system itself is held hostage by this war.
