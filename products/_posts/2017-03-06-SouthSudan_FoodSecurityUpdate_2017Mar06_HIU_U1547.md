tweet: "Famine declared in South Sudan, where about 42% of the population is severely food insecure."
---
On 20th February, the UN and South Sudanese Government declared a famine, affecting 100,000 people in multiple counties in Unity State. An estimated 4.9 million people are severely food insecure in South Sudan, about 42% of the population. Ongoing conflict and insecurity, attacks against aid workers, and poor road infrastructure impede humanitarian access and response.
