Since March, flooding across Afghanistan has displaced tens of thousands of people, killed livestock, and inundated villages. Heavy rains and warm spring temperatures accelerated snowmelt following a particularly harsh winter with above-average snowfall across much of the north. Sar-e Pul Province was the hardest hit by flooding and victims will require humanitarian assistance for several months.
