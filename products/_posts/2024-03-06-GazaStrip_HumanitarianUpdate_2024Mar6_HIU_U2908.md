The entire Gaza Strip population is facing severe levels of food insecurity, defined as populations in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), Emergency (IPC Phase 4), and Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). This is the highest share of a population facing these levels of food insecurity the IPC has ever classified. One-quarter of households are facing Catastrophe, characterized by extreme lack of food, starvation, and exhaustion of coping capacities. The Ministry of Health has attributed 18 deaths of children in northern Gaza Strip to starvation and dehydration. The breakdown of law and order, the absence of police, and the organized looting of humanitarian assistance are increasingly impeding aid delivery and fueling the risk of famine, according to WFP.
