UNAIDS estimates that over 36.7 million people live with HIV, 20.9 million of whom are on antiretroviral therapy. Although some countries have an adult HIV prevalence that is over 20 percent, many HIV positive people live in countries where overall HIV prevalence is low. World AIDS Day, December 1, is the annual observance of this epidemic and the people it affects.
