Earth Day's 2022 theme, "Invest in Our Planet," recognizes the urgent need for investment in green technology and infrastructure. A transition to renewable resources for energy production is critical to greenhouse gas emissions reductions, which are necessary for reducing global warming. Several countries generate the majority of their electrical energy with renewable resources and many more are on a positive trajectory in this regard, yet significant investments in the transition to renewable energy are still needed in all regions.
