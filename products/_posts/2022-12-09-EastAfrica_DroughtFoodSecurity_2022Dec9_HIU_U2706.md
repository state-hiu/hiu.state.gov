Acute food insecurity continues to rise in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia with 23 million people acutely food insecure due to persistent severe drought. According to food security organizations, parts of Somalia are at risk of famine. Four consecutive below-average rainy seasons since late 2020 have made the current drought the most extensive since 1981. The October–December 2022 rains began poorly with forecasts anticipating a fifth below-average season, and there is the potential for a sixth failed rainy season in March–May 2023.
