This map highlights the complexity and severity of the refugee crisis in Lebanon, which is currently suffering from the highest per-capita refugee influx in the world. As the humanitarian community and government continue to provide critical aid to Syrian and Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, many suffer from extreme poverty, difficult living conditions, and severe food insecurity. This map provides an overview of the refugee population and Lebanon's vulnerable communities, as determined by the UN.
