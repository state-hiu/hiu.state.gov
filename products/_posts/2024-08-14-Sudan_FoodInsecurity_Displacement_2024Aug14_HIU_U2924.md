Ongoing conflict in Sudan is worsening humanitarian conditions, with over 10 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 25.6 million people facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3â€“5). Areas in the southern half of Sudan at risk of famine include camps or concentrations of IDPs and refugees, with famine confirmed in Zamzam IDP camp south of El Fasher, North Darfur. Displaced populations in areas of conflict are difficult to reach and unable to access basic services and food aid, as aid operations remain constrained by conflict and insecurity, a lack of authorizations and bureaucratic impediments, and physical access issues due to the rainy season. Further expansion or intensification of conflict and barriers to aid delivery will likely increase the risk of famine and vulnerability of displaced populations.
