The UN called for $49 billion for its 2024 humanitarian programs, down from $56 billion in 2023. The smaller appeal comes as UN agencies navigate a steep anticipated downturn in aid budgets worldwide, at a time when 2023 donor contributions already only covered 43% of the $56 billion appeal. The smaller 2024 appeal represents the UNâ€™s reduction in targeted beneficiaries to only those in need of life-sustaining assistance. Worldwide, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance has tripled in the past decade and is very likely to continue to increase due to historically high levels of need stemming from conflicts, climate disasters, disease, and violence.
