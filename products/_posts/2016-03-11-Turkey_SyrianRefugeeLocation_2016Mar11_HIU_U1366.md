Turkey hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees, hosting over 2.7 millions Syrians who have registered under a temporary protection status. Turkey is also the primary transit country for Syrians seeking asylum in Europe, and Turkey and the EU are negotiating a joint action plan to address Syrian refugee needs and prevent irregular migration flows. Before an ISSG-facilitated cessation of hostilities went into effect on Feb. 27, over 75,000 Syrians were displaced in Northern Syria, further pressuring displacement sites and host communities along the Syria-Turkey border. The map shows the distribution of displaced Syrians within Syria and in Turkey, and gives a short snapshot of related current events.
