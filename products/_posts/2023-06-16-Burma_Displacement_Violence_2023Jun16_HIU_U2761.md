Internal displacement increased rapidly after the February 2021 coup d'état due to widespread violence against civilians by Burma’s regime and battles between regime security forces and armed opposition forces. The military pursued airstrikes, mass burnings, and civilian infrastructure attacks in opposition strongholds, particularly in Sagaing. The regime continues to restrict humanitarian access and the passage of relief supplies. Displacement to countries across the region has also continued.
