Globally, at least 108 million people are forcibly displaced due to persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations. More than half of the forcibly displaced population, or 60 million people, are internally displaced persons (IDPs) compared to 48 million refugees, asylum-seekers, and others in need of international protection. Ten countries and areas account for nearly 71% of the forcibly displaced population. The outbreak of conflict in Sudan and the Gaza Strip this year contributed to rapid displacement of populations, with 6.6 million Sudanese displaced within eight monthsand 1.9 million Gazans displaced within two months.
