tweet: "On #WorldHumanitarianDay2021 the HIU highlights the impact of internet (un)freedom on humanitarian responses. Besides pandemics, conflict, and natural disasters, humanitarians must increasingly contend with disinformation as well as communication restrictions and disruptions."
---
Government restrictions on internet and mobile communications, as well as limited access to information, can adversely affect humanitarian response operations in crisis-affected countries. Authoritarian regimes and non-state groups have been involved in disinformation efforts or in restricting access to the Internet or mobile communications in areas of need, which can impede humanitarian efforts.
