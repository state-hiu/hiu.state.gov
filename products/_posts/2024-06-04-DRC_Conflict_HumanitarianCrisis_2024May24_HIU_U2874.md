Clashes between the Rwanda-supported March 23 Movement (M23) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) security forces since 2022 are the latest in three decades of cyclic armed conflict that perpetuate chronic humanitarian need, even as intercommunal militia activity decreased from a peak in 2021. Over the past decade, 83% of conflict events took place in the eastern provinces of Ituri, Nord-Kivu, and Sud-Kivu, where the vast majority of the internally displaced (IDP) population is located. The DRC accounts for the worldâ€™s third largest internally displaced population, as well as the second largest population facing severe acute food insecurity. Humanitarian assistance will very likely continue to be inadequate to meet their needs.
