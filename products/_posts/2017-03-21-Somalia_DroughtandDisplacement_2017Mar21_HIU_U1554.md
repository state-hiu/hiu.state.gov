As a result of below average April-June 2016 rains followed by a failed October-December 2016 rainy season in many areas, over 2.9 million people in Somalia face acute food insecurity and will need emergency food aid in the coming months. Internal displacement is also an issue with an estimated 1.1 million IDPs currently in Somalia with about 192,000 being recently displaced due to drought.
