The American people, through the U.S. Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), support the global HIV/AIDS response through bilateral and regional programs in 65 countries. As a result of this commitment, the U.S. supported life-saving treatment for 11.5 million men, women and children worldwide. In addition, the United States is the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
