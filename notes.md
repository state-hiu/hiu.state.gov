## creating topojson

Originally a country file was dissolved by region in ArcGIS. Then the files was imported into a geodatabase, topology was created, and intersections were fixed. Also edits were made to clean up extra vertices and lines found within existing polygons. A shapefile was exported and then uploaded to mapshaper.org. In Map Shaper, the data was simplified at 70% and exported as topojson. 

## uploading thumbnails

Images for products are uploaded in the hiu-thumbnails S3 bucket under the products folder. This will fire off a lamda function that creates a 150px and 300px thumbnails and saves them in the resized folder in products.

- The lambda function code was taken from https://github.com/ysugimoto/aws-lambda-image

- The Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3 tutorial http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example.html was followed to configure everything in preperation for the lambda function
