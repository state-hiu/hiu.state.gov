## [Virtual Student Federal Service](https://vsfs.state.gov/)

The Humanitarian Information Unit's [MapGive](http://mapgive.state.gov) team accepts a few Virtual Student Federal Service (VSFS) interns each school year.  If interested, email MapGive at [mapgive@state.gov](mailto:mapgive@state.gov?subject=VSFS+Internship). U.S. students apply to the VSFS program once a year in July.

## [Jefferson Science Fellowship](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/Jefferson/)

The Jefferson Science Fellowship (JSF) is open to tenured, or similarly ranked, faculty from U.S. institutions of higher learning who are U.S. citizens. The application period opens in early August and closes at the end of October. Selected Jefferson Science Fellows spend one year on assignment at the U.S. Department of State or USAID as science advisors on foreign policy/international development issues.

## [AAAS Fellowship](https://careers.state.gov/work/fellowships/aaas)

AAAS Fellowships at State and USAID are open to U.S. citizens who have a PhD or an equivalent doctoral-level degree at the time of application â€“ or a master's degree in engineering and at least three years of post-degree professional experience. This is a year-long opportunity beginning September 1 and ending August 31.

## [Presidential Management Fellowship](https://www.pmf.gov/)

Bearing the Presidential moniker, the PMF Program is a flagship leadership development program at the entry level for advanced degree candidates. It was created more than three decades ago by Executive Order and has gone through many changes over the years. The Program attracts and selects the best candidates possible, but is really designed with a more narrow focus - developing a cadre of potential government leaders. It provides some sustenance during the first years of employment and encourages development of leadership capabilities. The PMF Program inculcates a lasting bond as well as a spirit of public service, ultimately encouraging and leading to a career in the government.
