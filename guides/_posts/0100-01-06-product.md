## Description

This guide provides instructions for how to publish products to the HIU Website.

### Bugs

If you find bugs in this guide, please get in contact with us at [HIU_DEV@state.gov](mailto:HIU_DEV@state.gov).

## Workflow

## Step 1: Pre-processing / Naming Convention

Before you upload any products to the HIU website, you'll need to choose a good filename.  The standard naming convention for HIU is:

```
Region_Name_Date_Organization_ID.pdf
```

This naming convention is similar to the naming convention for datasets, but not exactly the same.

**Region**

For `Region`, if just one country, use the country's short name.  If two countries, use both country names, such as `SyriaTurkey_`.  If more than two countries, use a sub-region name that makes sense and follows some standard understanding, such as `WestAfrica_`, `Global_`, or `EurasiaOceania_`.  Stay away from complex concepts, such as `TheLevant_`.  

For example:

```
Worldwide_LimitedAidAccess_2015Aug18_HIU_U1277.pdf
Africa_EbolaDiseaseWithoutBorders_2014Aug28_HIU_U1078.pdf
Syria_ConflictWithoutBorders_Displacement_2015Aug27_HIU_U1283.pdf
```

**Date**

For `Date`, generally pick the date the final product was published (rather than the last date of the underlying data used).  Date should be the format of `YEARMonthDate` with `Year` as 4 digits, `Month` in 3-letter shorthand, and `Date` as padded day of the month.

Thumbnails follow very similar naming convention.  In most cases, the name should only differ with a `150px.jpg` or `_300px.jpg` suffix, respectively.

## Step 2: Upload Products

Upload products to the product repository.  For the public HIU website, products are hosted on AWS S3.  That is `https://s3.amazonaws.com/hiu-products/`.

## Step 3: Upload Thumbnails

Upload thumbnails to the product thumbnail repository.  For the public HIU website, thumbanils are hosted on AWS S3.  That is `https://s3.amazonaws.com/hiu-thumbnails/products/`.

## Step 4: Create Post

Add a post to [_posts]({{ site.code }}/tree/{{ site.branch }}/products/_posts).  Include all the relavant information.  The description should be added after the second `---` and after all the other variables.

**Layout, Category**

The layout should always be `product` and the category should always be `products`.

**lat/lon**

If there is a latitude and longitude that can be associated with the project, add it.

**date_published**

The date should be in format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Title**

Generally speaking, the title should be the same name as on the actual PDF.

**Featured**
To feature the product, set `featured_main` or `featured_region` to `true` and set relevant feature orders.

For example:

```

layout: product
category: products
title: "World Humanitarian Day 2015: Limited Aid Access/Security Due to Conflict"
region_id: "global"
region_title: "Global & Transnational Products"

This map, prepared for World Humanitarian Day 2015, shows the generalized subnational areas around the world of limited humanitarian access and security due to conflict in 2014 – 2015, as well as a bar chart showing the trend of increased attacks on humanitarian aid workers since 2000.
```

## Step 5: Double-check

Double check that the product is now visible on the site.
