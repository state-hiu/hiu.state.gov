## Description

This guide provides instructions for how to manage events on the HIU website.

### Bugs

If you find bugs in this guide, please get in contact with us at [HIU_DEV@state.gov](mailto:HIU_DEV@state.gov).

## Workflow

## Step 1: Naming Convention

A good naming convention is to use dash-separated, lower-case words for the filename and `event_id`, such as:

```
ebola
nepal-earthquake
syria-crisis
```

If a date makes sense, most likely only append the year, like `nepal-earthquake-2015`.

## Step 2: Create Event

To create an event, add a post to [_posts]({{ site.code }}/tree/{{ site.branch }}/events/_posts).  Include all relevant information.  The description should be added after the second `---` and after all the other variables.

```
---
layout: event
category: events
title: "Nepal Earthquake"
event_id: nepal_earthquake 
featured: true
archived: false
lat: 28.087
lon: 86.092
keywords:
refurl:
  hdx: "https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/group/nepal-earthquake"

For the Nepal Earthquake, the Humanitarian Information Unit faciliated the sharing of high-resolution commercial satellite imagery, provided imagery services under the Imagery to the Crowd Initiative, and facilitated on-boarding of organizations into HDX.
```

## Step 3: Link Products

To link a new or existing product to an event, add the `event_id` from the event post (explained in the previous step) under the `events` variable.  You can link products to more than one event; just keep adding `  - event_id` below `events:`.  Once you rebuild the site, the product will be immediately available on the relevant event pages.

```
events:
  - nepal-earthquake
```

For example see this Ebola product:

```

layout: product

title: "Disease Without Borders: Ebola in West Africa"

region_title: "Africa"

The map illustrates the extent and severity of the current Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and highlights the number of cases and fatalities in all countries reporting Ebola cases. Ebola Treatment Units (both existing and under construction) are shown, and total population figures are for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Senegal, and Nigeria are also included.
```

## Step 4: Create Keyword Filter

The event's keyword filter will be used for filtering datasets returned from GeoNode for display under the event.  If no `keyword_filter` is specified, then all the GeoNode datasets will be displayed.  A dataset only needs to match one of the keywords to be displayed, so an `OR` boolean test.  For example:

```
keyword_filter:
  - nepal-earthquake
  - nepal
  - nepal-drr
```

## Step 5: Double-check

Double check that the event is live by going to its page.
