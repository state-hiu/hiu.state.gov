[hiu.state.gov](hiu.state.gov)
================
(trigger re-build)
## Description

The U.S. Department of State Humanitarian Information Unit's new public-facing website, hiu.state.gov.

## Installation

Site is tested and built using Ubuntu 16.04. To install locally, the [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator is required.

### re-build

## Gulp.js

[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow.

(note, gulp is not active now, need to re-implement)
If updated app.js javascript file (`lib/app.js`) , run gulp to minify and strip out comments:

```
gulp
```

## Implemented Leaflet Extensions

### leaflet-ajax

Allows you to call JSON via an Ajax call with a jsonp fallback. (https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/leaflet-ajax)

### leaflet-list-markers

A Leaflet Control for listing visible markers/features in a interactive box. (https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-list-markers)

Heavy customization was done to the leaflet-list-markers.src.js file. The code builds the product entries that get added to the sidebar. A minimized file will need to get built.

### leaflet-markercluster

Marker Clustering plugin for Leaflet. ver 1.0.3 (https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)

Only the MarkCluster.Default.css file is modified for customized style.

### leaflet-sidebar-v2

A responsive sidebar with tabs for Leaflet, OpenLayers, Google Maps, ... (https://github.com/Turbo87/sidebar-v2)

Both the leaflet-sidebar.js and leaflet-sidebar.css files are heavily customized.

## Implemented Search (used in Products Page)

### fuse.js
Lightweight fuzzy-search Javascript library.  (http://fusejs.io/) 

### Elasticlunr.js 
Lightweight full-text search engine in Javascript for browser search and offline search. (http://elasticlunr.com/)
This was also tested, but fuse.js was preferred due to its capabilities for fuzzy search and was faster.

### CSS

multiple libraries are used, however Sass/SCSS is mainly used along with bootstrap. Jekyll provides [built-in support for Sass](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/). The Bootstrap partials are in the _sass directory. The main Sass/SCSS file is named main.scss and is in the css directory. Jekyll automatically processes it and puts it in the site's destination folder.

## Analytics

Google Analytics is used to track page views and events.

Each tracked event has the following components:

- Category:
A category is a name that you supply as a way to group objects that you want to track. We are tracking 'product'

- Action:
Typically, you will use the action parameter to name the type of event or interaction you want to track for a particular web object. These are the following actions we are tracking: 'download - JPG', download - 'PDF', 'click - preview', 'link - preview', and 'click new product pin - preview'

- Label:
This is the url fragment of the product. It is in the following format: '# + 'region code' + ',' + 'product id'

## Other Notes

- This site uses reverse proxies configured on the server (we use NGINX in production) to redirect the JPG and PDF product URLs to the S3 bucket where HIU products are stored.

#### The events page is depreciated at this time
