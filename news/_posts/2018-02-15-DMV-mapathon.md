Lee Schwartz, Director of the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues, and Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) analysts presented to a group of university students from the Washington metropolitan area. Students learned about the U.S. Department of State’s Office of the Geographer and the Humanitarian Information Unit through several examples of HIU infographic production process – from the start of its concept to its impact on policymaker decision making.

Following the presentations, participants mapped [refugee settlements in northern Uganda](https://tasks.hotosm.org/project/4141) using OpenStreetMap. Our MapGive initiative has been supporting mapping projects in this region with **[satellite imagery services](https://mapgive.state.gov/ittc).**
