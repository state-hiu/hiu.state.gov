This is the 2nd year that Mapathons and Mapathon related activities were hosted at the American Association of Geographers (AAG) Annual Meeting. Attendees joined a community of online mappers and contributed to [five different OpenStreetMap (OSM) projects](http://aagmapathon.org/index.html#projects) supporting humanitarian and development efforts. Using satellite imagery and freely available OpenStreetMap editing platforms, participants traced, edited, and labeled key infrastructure (buildings, roads, etc.). This years event consisted of 7 paper sessions, 2 panel sessions, 2 poster session, 2 OSM activities, 6 lightning talks, and 2 Mapathons.
